# Creating Recipes

If you have ever searched for a recipe online, you will understand how overwhelming it can be to find one that's relatively simple, uses the ingredients you have in your kitchen, and meets your dietary needs. ChatGPT can help with this. It can become your personal assistant in the kitchen, helping you create delicious recipes tailored to your specific needs. ChatGPT is a gourmet chef!

Let's look at a basic example to get a taste of what ChatGPT is capable of:

<pre>
    Please create a recipe for a sauce that can be served with steak.
</pre>

<details>
    <summary>ChatGPT response</summary>
    ```md
    Sure! Here is a recipe for a simple and delicious steak sauce:

    Ingredients:

    1/2 cup beef broth
    2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
    2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
    1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
    2 teaspoons cornstarch
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    1/2 teaspoon onion powder
    salt and pepper to taste
    Instructions:

    1. In a small saucepan, whisk together the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, cornstarch, garlic powder, and onion powder.
    2. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
    3. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
    4. Serve the sauce with your favorite grilled or pan-fried steak. Enjoy!
    This sauce has a savory and slightly tangy flavor that goes well with a variety of steaks. You can also adjust the seasoning to taste if you prefer a more piquant or sweet sauce.
    ```

In the example I asked ChatGPT create a recipe for a sauce that can be served over steak. ChatGPT responded in three sections: first listing out the ingredients for the recipes, then listing the instructions for the dish, and finally writing a few sentences about the recipe. This is the general format that ChatGPT will always use when it is asked to create a recipe.
The prompt is broad, and the possibilities for this recipe are countless. If you're unsatisfied with the recipe, you can generate new ones with the regenerate button until you find the one you like!

Ideally, though, we want ChatGPT to give us the recipe we want the first time. We can do this by giving ChatGPT more information. Let's say we have some specific ingredients we'd like to include in the steak sauce. We can tell ChatGPT to include these ingredients by adjusting the prompt:

<pre>
Create a recipe for a sauce that can be served over steak. Include mushrooms, red wine, and garlic.
</pre>

<pre>
Here is a recipe for a rich and flavorful steak sauce with mushrooms, red wine, and garlic:

Ingredients:

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup sliced mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup red wine
1/2 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

1. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are browned and tender, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, or until fragrant.
3. Pour in the red wine and beef broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Stir in the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and dried thyme. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Continue simmering the sauce for an additional 5 minutes, or until it has thickened to your desired consistency.
6. Serve the sauce over grilled or pan-fried steak. Enjoy!
This steak sauce has a savory and slightly tangy flavor, with the richness of the red wine and the earthiness of the mushrooms and thyme. You can adjust the seasoning to taste if you prefer a more piquant or sweet sauce.

This is great! Now we have something that is closer to our desired recipe. (I actually made this recipe, and it was delicious!)
However, let's say that we don't have some of the ingredients that ChatGPT includes, or worse, we have an allergy to them or they don't meet our dietary needs. We can modify the prompt with the following to disclude the ingredients we don't want.

Add ChatGPT prompt here.

We now have a recipe that includes the ingredients we want and a recipe that discludes the ingredients we don't want. Alternatively, you could have used the following prompt instead of re-typing the original one:

Not sure what you want to eat? With ChatGPT you can input the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen and ask it to give you a recipe using some or all of those ingredients!

<pre>
Please create a recipe with some of the following ingredients: ground beef, onions, bell peppers, pasta, sour cream, ketchup, carrots, milk, eggs, spinach, and rice.
</pre>

Salt and pepper, to taste
For the Sauce:

1/4 cup ketchup

In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil over high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned.
Add the onions, bell peppers, and carrots to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly softened.
In a small bowl, whisk together the ketchup, sour cream, milk, and soy sauce to make the sauce. Pour it over the beef and vegetables in the skillet, and stir to coat.
Add the spinach to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until wilted.
In a separate pan, scramble 2 eggs.
Serve the stir fry over the cooked rice, and top with the scrambled egg.

Don't have any soy sauce? You can ask ChatGPT to change the recipe to use no soy sauce with the following prompt.

Note: While I'm sure that ChatGPT is capable of creating a solid recipe using all of the ingredients, some ingredients just don't mix well. A poor-tasting dish may be the result of the ingredients you asked ChatGPT to use rather than the limitations of ChatGPT itself.

Limitations:
ChatGPT is not very good at creating recipes that conform to a certain number of calories or macronutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat.
